## Project Architecture

### Current Implementation Status
- ‚úÖ **6-Tab Dashboard** - Professional HTML/CSS/JS interface
- ‚úÖ **15+ Congressional Members** - Expanded database with party/state/chamber data
- ‚úÖ **Committee Tracking** - Leadership positions and oversight areas
- ‚úÖ **Active Legislation** - 7 major bills with market impact analysis
- ‚úÖ **Pattern Recognition** - Committee-trading correlation analysis
- ‚úÖ **Intelligence Engine** - Python-based analysis with ML foundation

### Tech Stack Summary
- **Backend**: Python 3.13+ with pandas, scikit-learn, tensorflow
- **Frontend**: HTML/CSS/JS dashboard (React migration planned)
- **Data**: Sample data structure ready for real-time API integration
- **Analysis**: Congressional trading pattern recognition and scoring

## Key Principles
1. **Educational Focus**: All analysis for transparency and research purposes
2. **Data Accuracy**: Only publicly disclosed STOCK Act information
3. **Ethical Standards**: Promote accountability without harmful speculation
4. **Open Source**: Transparent methodology and reproducible research

## Development Workflow
- **Main Branch**: Stable version with core features
- **Feature Branches**: Active development (currently: `feature/data-expansion`)
- **Daily Workflow**: Use `/daily-dev` for routine development tasks
- **Quality Gates**: Pre-deployment validation with comprehensive checklists

- Roadmap: `.claude-suite/project/roadmap.md`  
- Tech Stack: `.claude-suite/project/tech-stack.md`
- Workflows: `.claude-suite/workflows/daily-dev.md`
- Checklists: `.claude-suite/project/checklists/pre-deploy.md`

## Testing & Validation
```bash
python3 src/analysis/congressional_analysis.py    # Test analysis engine
cd src/dashboard && python3 -m http.server 8000   # Test dashboard
/pre-deploy-check                                 # Full validation suite
```

## Educational & Legal Framework
