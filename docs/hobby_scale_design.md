# Hobby Congressional Trading Agent: Personal Project Design

**Author:** Manus AI  
**Date:** June 26, 2025  
**Project Type:** Personal Hobby/Learning Project

## Executive Summary

This document presents a simplified, hobby-scale design for a congressional trading agent suitable for an individual developer working on a personal side project. Unlike enterprise-scale systems, this approach prioritizes learning, experimentation, and modest returns over institutional-grade infrastructure and massive capital deployment.

The "CongressWatch" system is designed to be built and operated by a single developer with a budget under $500/month, focusing on educational value and small-scale automated trading. The system will track congressional trades, generate simple signals, and execute small trades through retail brokerages while maintaining compliance with personal trading regulations.

## Project Philosophy and Scope

### Hobby Project Goals

This is fundamentally a learning and experimentation project rather than a serious investment strategy. The primary goals are to understand congressional trading patterns, learn about automated trading systems, and potentially generate modest supplemental income while gaining valuable technical experience.

The system should be simple enough to build and maintain as a weekend project, with total development time under 100 hours spread over 3-6 months. The focus is on rapid prototyping, learning, and iteration rather than production-grade reliability or institutional compliance.

Financial expectations should be modest - the goal is to beat basic index fund returns on a small portfolio ($1,000-$10,000) while learning about quantitative trading, data analysis, and financial markets. Any profits are secondary to the educational value and technical experience gained.

### Simplified Architecture Approach

The architecture follows a "good enough" philosophy, using simple, proven technologies and avoiding over-engineering. The system will run on a single cloud instance or even a home computer, with basic monitoring and minimal operational complexity.

Data storage will use simple SQLite or PostgreSQL databases without complex time-series optimizations. Processing will be batch-oriented rather than real-time, running daily or weekly analysis rather than millisecond-latency trading.

The system will integrate with retail trading platforms like Alpaca or Interactive Brokers' retail API, focusing on simple buy/hold strategies rather than complex algorithmic trading. Risk management will be basic but effective, with simple position sizing and stop-loss rules.

## Simplified System Design

### Core Components

The system consists of four main components that can be built incrementally: Data Collector, Signal Generator, Trade Executor, and Monitor Dashboard. Each component is designed to be simple, maintainable, and educational.

**Data Collector** fetches congressional trading data from free or low-cost APIs, stores it in a local database, and performs basic data cleaning and validation. This component runs on a daily schedule and handles API rate limiting and error recovery gracefully.

**Signal Generator** analyzes the collected data to identify potentially profitable trades using simple heuristics and basic machine learning. The focus is on interpretable signals that provide learning opportunities rather than complex black-box algorithms.

**Trade Executor** places small trades through retail brokerage APIs based on generated signals. The component includes basic risk management, position sizing, and order management suitable for personal trading accounts.

**Monitor Dashboard** provides a simple web interface to view portfolio performance, recent trades, and system status. The dashboard emphasizes learning and understanding over professional-grade analytics.

### Technology Stack

The technology stack prioritizes simplicity, low cost, and ease of development over performance and scalability. Python serves as the primary language for its extensive libraries and beginner-friendly ecosystem.

**Backend Framework**: Flask or FastAPI for simple web APIs and dashboard serving. These frameworks provide sufficient functionality without the complexity of enterprise frameworks.

**Database**: SQLite for development and small-scale deployment, with optional PostgreSQL for slightly larger datasets. No complex time-series databases or distributed systems are needed.

**Data Processing**: Pandas for data manipulation and analysis, with scikit-learn for basic machine learning. These libraries provide powerful capabilities while remaining accessible to hobby developers.

**Trading Integration**: Alpaca API for commission-free stock trading, with paper trading mode for safe testing and learning. The API is well-documented and designed for retail developers.

**Deployment**: Single DigitalOcean droplet or AWS EC2 instance, with simple cron jobs for scheduling. No container orchestration or complex deployment pipelines are needed.

**Monitoring**: Simple logging to files with basic email alerts for critical issues. Professional monitoring tools are unnecessary for hobby-scale operations.

### Data Sources and Integration

The system will use free or low-cost data sources appropriate for hobby projects, avoiding expensive enterprise data feeds. Congressional trading data will come from publicly available APIs with reasonable rate limits.

**Primary Data Source**: Finnhub's free tier provides 60 API calls per minute for congressional trading data, sufficient for daily batch processing. The free tier includes basic congressional trading information without premium features.

**Backup Data Source**: Financial Modeling Prep's free tier offers 250 API calls per day, providing redundancy and additional data validation. The service includes senate trading data and basic company information.

**Market Data**: Alpha Vantage's free tier provides 5 API calls per minute for stock prices and basic market data. This is sufficient for daily portfolio valuation and basic technical analysis.

**News Data**: Optional integration with free news APIs for basic sentiment analysis and context around congressional trades. This adds educational value without significant cost.

### Trading Strategy

The trading strategy emphasizes simplicity, interpretability, and risk management over sophisticated algorithms. The approach should be easy to understand, modify, and learn from while providing reasonable performance expectations.

**Core Strategy**: Direct replication of congressional trades with appropriate delays and position sizing. When a congress member buys a stock, the system considers buying a small position after the disclosure becomes public.

**Signal Filters**: Basic filters to identify potentially informed trades, such as large position changes, trades by committee members in relevant sectors, or unusual trading activity by multiple members.

**Position Sizing**: Simple fixed-dollar amounts ($100-$500 per trade) or percentage-based sizing (1-2% of portfolio per position). Risk management focuses on limiting individual position sizes rather than complex portfolio optimization.

**Exit Strategy**: Simple time-based exits (hold for 30-90 days) or basic profit/loss targets (Â±10-20%). The focus is on learning about trade timing and market behavior rather than optimizing returns.

**Risk Management**: Maximum portfolio allocation per stock (5-10%), maximum number of positions (10-20), and simple stop-loss rules. These limits prevent catastrophic losses while allowing for learning experiences.
