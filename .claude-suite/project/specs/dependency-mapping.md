## Dependency Resolution Strategies

### Early Validation Approach
1. **Proof of Concept Development**: Build minimal versions of critical dependencies early
2. **Stakeholder Validation**: Confirm requirements with academic and journalism partners
3. **Technical Feasibility Testing**: Validate ML model accuracy potential with sample data
4. **Performance Benchmarking**: Test database and API performance under expected loads

### Incremental Development Strategy
1. **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)**: Implement core functionality first
2. **Feature Flagging**: Enable gradual rollout of dependent features
3. **A/B Testing**: Validate assumptions about user behavior and preferences
4. **Continuous Integration**: Ensure dependencies don't break as development progresses

### Fallback Planning
1. **Alternative Implementations**: Plan simpler alternatives for high-risk features
2. **Graceful Degradation**: Ensure system functions even if some dependencies fail
3. **Manual Fallbacks**: Identify processes that can be done manually if automation fails
4. **Timeline Flexibility**: Build buffer time into schedules for dependency resolution
