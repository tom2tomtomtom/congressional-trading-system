# Congressional Trading Intelligence System - Architectural Decisions

> Created: January 31, 2025
> Format: Decision Record

## January 31, 2025: Hybrid Dashboard Architecture

**ID:** DEC-001
**Status:** Implemented
**Category:** Frontend Architecture

### Decision
Implement hybrid HTML/CSS/JavaScript dashboard with planned React migration, rather than immediate React-only approach.

### Context
Needed functional dashboard quickly for testing and demonstration while preserving flexibility for future React enhancement. Team wanted to avoid React complexity during rapid prototyping phase.

### Consequences
**Positive:**
- Rapid prototyping and immediate functionality
- No build process complexity during development
- Easy to modify and test changes quickly
- Minimal dependencies for core functionality

**Trade-offs:**
- Will require future migration to React for advanced features
- Limited reusability of components
- Less sophisticated state management

## January 31, 2025: Python-Centric Intelligence Engine

**ID:** DEC-002
**Status:** Implemented
**Category:** Backend Architecture

### Decision
Build core intelligence and analysis engine in Python with extensive ML/data science library ecosystem.

### Context
Congressional trading analysis requires sophisticated statistical analysis, machine learning, and financial data processing. Python provides the richest ecosystem for these requirements.

### Consequences
**Positive:**
- Access to pandas, scikit-learn, tensorflow for analysis
- Extensive financial data libraries (yfinance, alpha-vantage)
- Rich visualization options (matplotlib, plotly, seaborn)
- Large community for financial analysis patterns

**Trade-offs:**
- Additional complexity for full-stack deployment
- Need to bridge Python backend with JavaScript frontend
- Performance considerations for real-time processing

## January 31, 2025: Educational/Research Focus

**ID:** DEC-003
**Status:** Implemented
**Category:** Product Strategy

### Decision
Position system as educational transparency tool rather than trading advisory platform.

### Context
Congressional trading analysis exists in sensitive legal and ethical territory. Clear educational focus ensures compliance and appropriate use.

### Consequences
**Positive:**
- Clear legal and ethical framework
- Attracts academic and journalism partnerships
- Avoids regulatory complexity of financial advice
- Promotes democratic transparency and accountability

**Trade-offs:**
- Limits monetization opportunities
- Requires careful messaging and disclaimers
- Must balance transparency with responsible disclosure

## January 31, 2025: Modular Component Architecture

**ID:** DEC-004
**Status:** Implemented
**Category:** System Design

### Decision
Organize system into distinct modules: core intelligence, analysis, and dashboard components.

### Context
System complexity requires clear separation of concerns for maintainability and future expansion. Different modules have different update cycles and responsibilities.

### Consequences
**Positive:**
- Clear separation between data processing and presentation
- Easy to test and develop modules independently
- Facilitates team collaboration on different components
- Enables API development for external integrations

**Trade-offs:**
- Additional abstraction layers
- Need for consistent interfaces between modules
- More complex deployment and integration testing

## January 31, 2025: Sample Data During Development

**ID:** DEC-005
**Status:** Implemented
**Category:** Development Strategy

### Decision
Use realistic sample data during development phase before implementing real-time API integrations.

### Context
Needed functional system for testing and demonstration without dependencies on external APIs or complex data pipelines during initial development.

### Consequences
**Positive:**
- Rapid development and testing without API dependencies
- Consistent test data for debugging and demonstration
- No rate limiting or API key management during development
- Easy to modify and expand sample datasets

**Trade-offs:**
- Must eventually migrate to real data sources
- Sample data may not reflect all edge cases
- Risk of sample data patterns influencing algorithm design

## January 31, 2025: Git Feature Branch Strategy

**ID:** DEC-006
**Status:** Implemented
**Category:** Development Workflow

### Decision
Use feature branches for major enhancements with main branch for stable releases.

### Context
System is under active development with significant feature additions planned. Need to maintain stable version while developing data expansion features.

### Consequences
**Positive:**
- Stable main branch for demonstrations and sharing
- Safe experimentation in feature branches
- Clear separation between stable and experimental features
- Easy rollback if features cause issues

**Trade-offs:**
- Additional git complexity and merge management
- Need to maintain multiple branches
- Potential for feature branches to diverge significantly
